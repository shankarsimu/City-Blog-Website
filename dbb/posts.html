There are 51 Shakti Peethas and 26 Upa Peethas spread across the Indian sub-continent. 51 Shakti Peethas are believed to be representing the 51 letters in Sanskrit alphabet. Sati Devi's breasts are believed to have fallen here in Tara Tarini. The Shakti of the shrine is addressed as Maa Tara Devi.The origin of Shakti Peethas are related to the mythology of Daksha yagna and Sati's self-immolation. The Shakti Peetha shrines lead to the development of Shaktism in India.</p>
